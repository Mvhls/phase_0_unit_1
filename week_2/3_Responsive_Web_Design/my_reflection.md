# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?(Responsive web design is programming a web page to be responsive to more than one device, browser etc. Through the use of web design, a web page becomes more universal. I feel this is an excellent practice considering the various ways that someone is able to visit websites.)
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?(The increased use of smart phones and tablets to access the web have changed web design significantly. You want all of your visitors and clients to recieve the most out of your web page.)
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
