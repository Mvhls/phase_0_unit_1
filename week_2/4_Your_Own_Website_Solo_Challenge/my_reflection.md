# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: <a href="http://mvhls.github.io/"></a>

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience?<br>-User experience seems important because it revolves around the fact that customers and clients are going to be viewing a web page. The more enjoyable it is to use and browse a web page, the more likely a customer will return.
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)<br>-I like the idea of user experience, and I believe that it is tied into everything else I am learning. It is fun planning and wireframing a website when I have UX in mind.
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?<br>-My process was to wireframe a page that would have a similar layout to the other ones on my website. Once the wireframe was layed out, I made an html and css file that had the basic backbone, and I used it with my other html files.
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?<br>-There are still many things I would like to change about my website. I did not spend much time changing the colors of my website as much as I wanted to because I was focused on other execises. I want to change the way my links, fonts, pictures and general UX.
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?<br>-I am still having problems with @fontface. The general Idea is confusing to me and I would like to learn more about it.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.<br>-Again, I would like to mention <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">MDN</a> as a good resource for me. Very in depth and good examples to reference when stuck.
